	<command title="contact" description="Does a query for a contact's details (specified in the command arguments) from the device address book. For example, to find all contacts in the device address book that contain the name 'Yunis', use the following command:

	<command title="get" description="Fetches one or more files from the device's file system or media card. Wildcards are supported. For example, to fetch all image files on the device that start with 'Apple', use the following command:
	get Apple*.jpg

To fetch all text files that contain the word 'Yunis', use the following command:
	get *Yunis*.txt

There may be cases where your query is too broad, and matches too many files. For example, a query like:
	get A*.txt
can produce a really large result. In that case the app will return you a list of all the files that matched the query. You should then instead specify the exact file that you are looking for.

To fetch a very specific file, provide the full path to the file as an argument. For example, to fetch the file named 'abdul khaliq.txt' located in the documents folder of the device's SD card, use the following command:
	get /accounts/1000/removable/sdcard/documents/abdul khaliq.txt

To fetch the file 'abdul khaliq.txt' that is located in the documents folder of the device's local storage, use the following command instead:
	get /accounts/1000/shared/documents/abdul khaliq.txt" />

You can also specify the quality of the recording by appending 'hi' or 'lo' without quotes after the duration. For example to record high-quality audio for 15 seconds use:
	mic 15 hi

If no argument is specified after the 'mic' command, the default value of 10 seconds is used and low-quality recording is used." />
